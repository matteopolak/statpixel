# Introduction

StatPixel is a Discord bot that provides statistics for the Hypixel Minecraft server. It is strongly macro-driven for maximum performance, which also allows features to be generalized to all commands at the same time.

StatPixel is written in Rust and uses the [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) library for interacting with Discord.

A few key features include:

- Localization
  - Available in 28 languages
- Customization
  - Themes
  - Custom images
- Unique features
  - Historical data
  - Data projections
  - Command identifiers for use with the [Image API](https://statpixel.xyz/docs/api)
  - Data comparisons
